# La Growth Machine — B2B Outreach & Pipeline Analytics

Analyze LinkedIn & email outreach campaigns, track pipeline performance, and review lead conversations — for RevOps, Sales Managers, and SDR teams.

---

La Growth Machine connects your AI assistant to your outbound revenue stack — giving RevOps engineers, Sales Managers, and SDR teams instant access to campaign performance, lead engagement data, and message sequences across LinkedIn and email. Stop switching between dashboards to answer "what's working?". Ask your AI instead.

---

## Compatibility

This MCP server works with any MCP-compatible AI client:

- **Claude Desktop** (Anthropic)
- **Claude Code** (CLI & IDE extensions)
- **Cursor**, **Windsurf**, and other MCP-enabled editors
- Any client that supports the [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io)

---

## Why connect La Growth Machine to your AI?

Your outreach data is only useful if you can act on it. With this extension, your AI becomes your outbound analyst — surfacing what's working, what's stalling, and where to focus next.

**Built for:**
- **RevOps & GTM Engineers** who orchestrate the revenue stack and need fast, flexible access to campaign performance
- **Sales Managers & Team Leads** who need visibility on team activity and pipeline contribution without digging through dashboards
- **Sales Reps** managing live conversations and follow-ups across channels

---

## What you can do

**Analyze campaign performance**
Compare reply rates, acceptance rates, and conversion metrics across campaigns — and get a diagnosis, not just a table.

**Audit your message sequences**
Pull the full message flow for any campaign. Identify weak touchpoints or flag messages that may be dragging down your reply rate.

**Explore leads and audiences**
Browse leads by audience, filter by status, or deep-dive into a specific lead's profile: company, role, email, LinkedIn URL.

**Read full conversation threads**
Get the complete message history for any lead across all channels (email + LinkedIn) — with context, not just raw logs.

**Track engagement activity**
View all actions taken on a lead: connection requests sent, messages delivered, replies received, follow-ups triggered.

**Build audiences from a LinkedIn URL**
Drop in a LinkedIn search, Sales Navigator search, or LinkedIn post URL — your AI creates the audience and triggers the lead import in one shot.

**Personalize AI-generated outreach**
Save tone and style preferences per La Growth Machine identity, so your AI generates on-brand messages that match your voice.

## Go deeper with LGM Skills

The MCP gives your AI access to your data. **LGM Skills** give it the expertise to act on it.

Skills are specialized AI instructions that work hand-in-hand with this MCP — the MCP surfaces your campaign data, the skill knows how to analyze it and turn it into actionable recommendations.

### Available now

**Campaign Analyzer**
Pulls your campaign stats and sequences via the MCP, then runs a structured analysis to identify what's hurting your reply rate — weak subject lines, poor sequencing, missing follow-ups — and gives you prioritized recommendations to fix it.

> *"Analyze my 'VP Sales Q2' campaign and tell me what to improve."*

### Coming soon

- **Segmentation Advisor** — Audit your audience targeting and flag ICP mismatches before they hurt performance
- **Copywriting Coach** — Review your message sequences against outreach best practices and rewrite underperforming steps

All LGM Skills are available at: [https://github.com/laGrowthMachine/gtm-system](https://github.com/laGrowthMachine/gtm-system)

## Usage Examples

### Diagnose a campaign that's underperforming

**You:** "My 'VP Sales Q2' campaign has a low reply rate. Show me the message sequence and stats."

**AI:** Fetches campaign KPIs (acceptance rate, reply rate, conversion) and the full message sequence. Identifies which steps have drop-offs and flags messages that may be too generic or too long.

> **Want deeper recommendations?** Install the [Campaign Analyzer skill](https://lagrowthmachine.com/.well-known/skills/index.json?utm_source=claude&utm_medium=mcp&utm_campaign=claude-store) to get structured, actionable improvements — not just data.

---

### Get a full picture of a lead before calling them

**You:** "Show me everything about John Smith at Acme Corp — conversation history, activity log, and their LinkedIn profile."

**AI:** Pulls the full engagement timeline: messages sent and received, connection status, reply content — giving you a complete pre-call brief in seconds.

---

### Weekly team pipeline review

**You:** "List all running campaigns, their reply rates, and flag anything below 10% acceptance."

**AI:** Generates a structured overview of active campaigns with key metrics, highlights underperformers, and surfaces which campaigns need attention.

> **Want to fix the underperformers?** Install the [Campaign Analyzer skill](https://lagrowthmachine.com/.well-known/skills/index.json?utm_source=claude&utm_medium=mcp&utm_campaign=claude-store) for ICP and copy recommendations.

---

### Build an audience straight from a Sales Nav URL

**You:** "Create a new audience called 'DACH VPs of Sales' from this Sales Nav search — use my main LinkedIn identity. Here's the URL: https://www.linkedin.com/sales/search/people?..."

**AI:** Calls `list_identities` to resolve your main identity, then `create_audience_from_linkedin_url` to kick off the import. The import runs asynchronously — list your audiences and check progress with `get_audience`.

---

### Audit your outreach sequence before launch

**You:** "Show me the message flow for my 'DACH Enterprise' campaign — I want to check the timing and content before it goes live."

**AI:** Displays the full sequence with message content, channel (email vs LinkedIn), and step order — ready for a final review.

> **Not sure if the copy is strong enough?** The Copywriting Coach skill (coming soon) will review each message against outreach best practices and suggest rewrites.
